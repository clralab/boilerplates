# CLRALab Boilerplates

Hello, welcome to my personal collection of templates and configuration files :wave:

I'm Calum, a finance professional by trade who is passionate about leadership and technology.

Please be aware, while I strive to balance life, technology and products change over time and code here might break. 
However, I will be trying my best to keep this as up to date as possible. If it breaks for you, chances are it is broken for me too.

## Home Lab Setup

My underlying system setup consists of a physical development server and a production server.
Both of these computers are running Lubuntu LTS and are running Docker containers.
There is a Synology 220j NAS that acts as a File Server and NFS for Docker Volumes.
DNS is being managed by a Bind9 container. DHCP and Vlans are managed by the physical router.
